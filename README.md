# Squadron Level Purchase Request And Management System (SL PRAMS)

SL PRAMS (pronounced 'slow' PRAMS) is a self-contained application that allows Squadron Level (SL) personnel to submit purchase requests.  

This system leverages a database for accounting and management for historical usage in Squadron planning for fiscal year budget execution.

## Getting Started

Build the self-contained application and deploy to end users.

Database configuration must be accomplished before the program can successfully execute.

### Prerequisites

For Debugging & code review:
Visual Studio 2017 or other capable IDE

For execution:
A windows 7 or newer operating system
Access to a configured SL PRAMS database


### Installing

Build the application in your IDE and deploy to end users.  

The application must be hard-coded to reference the targeted database in this alpha build.

## Code tests

No tests currently exist in this alpha.



## Deployment

Provide end users with the application
