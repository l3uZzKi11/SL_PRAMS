# Squadron Level Purchase Request And Management System (SL PRAMS)

SL PRAMS (pronounced 'slow' PRAMS) is a self-contained application that allows Squadron Level (SL) personnel to submit purchase requests.  

This system leverages a database for accounting and management for historical usage in Squadron planning for fiscal year budget execution.

## CSC425 Module 3 STATUS

### This project is currently in the Beta for the GUI.
##### Final tweaks to the UI have been completed and primary functionality has been adequately tested
##### Local network database has been successfully configured and tested.
##### The ability to capture the user input and validate entries is the major component to be completed in Module 3 for proper systems integration to work.
##### There are no errors in the code nor bugs on user actions.
The system is currently configured to only work on my laptop so full functionality by others would require the VM files which are rather large.
alternatively, i've created some videos showing the application in action for review that covers the majority of the applications use cases.


### The Database Works though!
its happily chugging along being its database self.
The email functionality/watchdog service is completely inoperable at this point.  This will be the primary focus in module 4.

# My laptop DIED
### Horribly and irreversibly
this, along with long shiftwork prior to my departure, and travel limitations i've lost 5-6 days of productivity... so the progress thus far makes me feel good!

## Getting Started

Build the self-contained application and deploy to end users.

Database configuration must be accomplished before the program can successfully execute.

### Prerequisites

For Debugging & code review:
Visual Studio 2017 or other capable IDE

For execution:
A windows 7 or newer operating system
Access to a configured SL PRAMS database


### Installing

Build the application in your IDE and deploy to end users.  

The application must be hard-coded to reference the targeted database in this alpha build.

## Code tests

No tests currently exist in this alpha.
unit testing is intended for late beta builds



## Deployment

Provide end users with the application
